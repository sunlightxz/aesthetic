                We’ve worked extensively in terms of geography and sector,
                developing a variety of work — products, services, and
                experiences — that has taught us that a well-defined visual
                strategy is key to bring visibility, credibility, and funds to
                any organization. Starting in 2021, we decided to plant a tree
                for each client that we work with.
